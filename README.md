ATTIMO: AdapTive TImeseries MOtifs
=====================================

This is the implementation of the ATTIMO algorithm for fast mining
of timeseries motifs, with probabilistic guarantees.

## Installation

First, you need to install Rust on your system. The simplest way is to visit
[https://rustup.rs/]() and follow the instructions there. You will need the
`nightly` toolchain:

    curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly

After that, you can just run

    cargo install --locked --force --path .

At this point, you should have the `attimo` command available on your system.

## Running

Executing the command with no arguments shows a short help message.

    ‚ùØ attimo
    Required positional arguments not provided:
        path
    Required options not provided:
        --window
        --motifs
        --memory

The flag `--help` gives a more comprehensive overview

## Data format

`attimo` works with univariate time series in a very common format: text files
with one value per line:

    1.1292
    1.1096
    1.0986
    1.0925
    1.0889
    1.0815
    1.0767
    1.073
    1.0681
    1.0608
